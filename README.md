### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a student at Far Eastern Federal University of Russia going for a bachelors degree in computer science!

Currently pursuing algorithms and data structures to get ready for any interview ever possible.

If you want to look at my projects, just go to any repo, most of them contain images of the working product, but some are still in the works...

### Currently working on:
- https://github.com/asap-it
- FarPost iOS App
- Some personal projects
- And of course course projects from FEFU
